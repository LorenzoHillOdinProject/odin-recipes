    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as butter.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Sliced Bread</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 Oz. Cheddar Cheese, Sliced</li>
        <li>Tomato soup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bread on a cutting board and spread mayonnaise over top side of each; this is key to a golden, delectable crunch. </li>
        <li> Heat a small skillet (nonstick, ideally) over medium. Slide in half of butter. When it melts, place 1 slice of bread, mayonnaise side down, in skillet; top with cheese; season with pepper. Top with second slice of bread, mayonnaise side up. </li>
        <li> When underside is golden brown, about 4 minutes, turn sandwich and add remaining butter to skillet. Press down on sandwich to encourage even browning and to help melt cheese—be gentle, don’t smash it.</li>
        <li>Cook until second side is golden brown and cheese is melted. Eat immediately, preferably with soup.</li>
    </ol>
